# IaC comparison 2021

- [IaC comparison 2021](#iac-comparison-2021)

This repo intends to show the actual possibilities to do Infrastructure as Code (IaC). When it started with VMWare roughly 15 years ago weren't so many people and either ways to create infrastructure in an automated way. With the cloud, disruption became easier to manage infrastructure in a more DevOps way. The real DevOps thing is to put together Dev and Ops, so why aren't we yet capable to code our infrastructure really like a piece of code in our loved IDE? 🤔
Buddy, let me say that now we can 🎉 !! Yup! AWS CDK, Terraform Isn't it amazing? 🥰 At least for me it's! 😍
